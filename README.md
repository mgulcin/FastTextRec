This work combines ideas from FastText and recommendation systems. \
It aims to recommend top-k venues by utilizing the sequentiality feature of check-ins and a recent vector space embedding method, namely the FastText. In general, this work: 
        
* Forms groups of check-ins
* Learns the vector space representations of the venues
* Utilizes the learned embeddings to make venue recommendations
